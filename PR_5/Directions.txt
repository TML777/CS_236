Objectives - Implement Kruskal's algorithm with Union/Find data structures

The graph below is from the Minimum Spanning Tree lecture.  For vertices, you can use numbers 
instead of letters.  Keep the edge weights the same, the result of your program should be 38.

Vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G <=> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Sample Output
  Finding MST using Kruskal's Algorithm
  Edges of MST are
  1 - 6 = 5
  1 - 2 =  6
  2 - 7 = 7
  3 - 7 = 5
  5 - 7 = 7
  4 - 5 = 8
  Weight of MST is 38
