Objectives: Find the shortest path in the Airline Network program using DFS or BFS algorithm
Write a program to find the shortest route in an airline network from a given start city to a given 
destination city using Depth First Search.
An unweighted digraph represented by its adjacency list is used for the network, and the information 
needed to construct is read from a network file.  

Network file content:
Los_Angeles
3 3 4 6        
San_Francisco
3 1 3 4
Denver
3 1 2 7
Chicago
2 3 8
Boston

New_York

Network file details
- The order of cities are arranged from LA(1), SAN(2), DEN(3), CHI(4), BOS(5), NYK(6), MIA(7), NOL(8).
- First digit is the number of out-degrees; other digits are the destinations of out-degrees.
    Example: New Orleans - 2 1 7: New Orleans connects to LA (1) and MIA (7).
