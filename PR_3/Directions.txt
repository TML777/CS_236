AVL Tree Implementation program 

Important note: You must separate your program into three files: header file (*.h), implementation file 
(*.cpp) and main file (*.cpp).  

Write a program to build an AVL tree by accepting the integers input from users.  For each input, 
balance the tree and display it on the screen; you then calculate the indorder traversals as well. There 
should be a menu to drive the program.  It should be similar as follows:

                         AVL Tree Implementation
        A: Insert an integer to tree and show the balanced tree at each insertion.
        B: Display the balanced tree and show inorder traversal.
        C: Exit

To be sure, your program is correctly working, use the following data to test AVL tree:

15, 18, 10, 7, 57, 6, 13, 12, 9, 65, 19, 16, 23

You should perform more test with different data sets.
